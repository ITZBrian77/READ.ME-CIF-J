CIF - Coding is Fun


CIF stands for Coding is Fun. We are a nonprofit organization that provides coding classes for free in Python, Javascript, Markup and more.


Classes are referred to as beginner, junior and senior respectively. In the junior class, we create cool projects (all stored in GitHub), and we write about our projects on Medium. (see example post by Jessica Chen).


Project 1: Number guessing game


Our first project is a simple game where you guess an integer using Python. We also:


Play with the random library


Try out loops and functions


Brainstorm ideas to make the game interesting


Use flow charts to design our code
